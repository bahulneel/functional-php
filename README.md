This library provides a collection of useful programming concepts that I have
collected from using other languages. Most of them come from the
[clojure](http://clojure.org) programming language but I expect to be adding more
as I find them.

At present we have support for the following concepts:

 - Runtime polymorphism via:
    - Multi-methods
    - Protocols
 - Immutable data structures:
    - Persistent Vectors
 - Transducers

## Runtime Polymorphism

### Multi-methods

### Protocols

## Immutable Data Structures

### Persistent Vectors
